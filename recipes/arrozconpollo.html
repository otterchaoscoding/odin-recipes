        <h1>Arroz con Pollo</h1>
        <img src="../images/arrozpic.jpeg" alt="a picture of a puerto rican style chicken and rice dish">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A traditional, Puerto Rican style meal made with seasoned chicken and rice. This is my take
            on one of my favorite family dishes. The added chorizo and olives add a fun, salty surprise. 
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>rice</li>
            <li>gandules</li>
            <li>chicken (i prefer thighs but you can use drums)</li>
            <li>red pepper</li>
            <li>white onion</li>
            <li>green pepper</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>cilantro</li>
            <li>culantro</li>
            <li>olives</li>
            <li>chorizo</li>
            <li>sazon</li>
            <li>chicken bouillon</li>
            <li>adobo con complete (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>prepare the broth. i prefer to add the chicken to a pressure cooker with the bouillon.
                you can also boil the chicken in a pot. the pressure cooker method is faster.
            </li>
            <li>once the chicken has cooked you can set it aside. if you did not choose boneless thighs,
                you can easily separate the bone from the meat. toss the bones. keep the meat. set aside 
                the broth for later as well.
            </li>
            <li>while the broth is cooking, prepare the sofrito and set aside. my preferred method of 
                preparation is to add the red pepper, white onion, green pepper, garlic, cilantro, and 
                culantro to a food processor and blend together. you can also chop everything down to 
                your preferred size instead.
            </li>
            <li>cut the chorizo into small pieces and add to a room temperature pot</li>
            <li>turn the stove on low-medium heat and allow the fat to render from the chorizo. cook 
                chorizo to preferred crispness. I prefer just a light golden brown layer of crispiness.
            </li>
            <li>remove the chorizo from the pan. add the sofrito to the chorizo oil. fry lightly until
                fragrant. add the gandules, sazon, and optional adobe. cook for a few minuten then stir
                in the chicken.
            </li>
            <li>add the rice, broth, and olives. stir and allow everything to come to a boil</li>
            <li>cover the pot and lower the temperature to simmer</li>
            <li>set a timer for 20 minutes</li>
            <li>do NOT -i repeat- do NOT lift the lid at any point. resist all tempation to stir</li>
            <li>once the 20 minutes has elapsed remove the pot from the heat and allow to sit for 10
                minutes
            </li>
            <li>remove the lid and behold the glory that is arroz con pollo. you may now stir to fluff
                up the rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
